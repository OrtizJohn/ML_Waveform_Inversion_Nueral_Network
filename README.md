# ML_Waveform_Inversion_Nueral_Network
 In geophysics siesmic waveform inversion can produce quantities of interest if the subsurface of the earth. The goal of this project was to reproduce a Green's function through training a Nueral Network to predict the propagation of couple surface waves in the locad Denver/Boulder Colorado Area
